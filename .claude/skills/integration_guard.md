# Integration Guard Skill

## Purpose
Safely integrate new features, components, or systems while ensuring no existing functionality is broken, no regressions are introduced, and no unintended side effects occur.

## When to Use
- Adding new features to existing systems
- Integrating third-party libraries or services
- Modifying core system components
- Deploying updates to production systems
- Connecting new data sources
- Implementing API changes
- Updating dependencies

## Inputs
- New feature or component to integrate
- Existing system architecture
- Current functionality baseline
- Test suite results
- Dependency requirements
- Configuration changes
- Impact assessment

## Outputs
- Safe integration pathway
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Regression prevention measures
- Side effect analysis
- Compatibility validation
- Rollback procedures
- Integration success verification

## Constraints
- Preserve all existing system behaviors
- Prevent any breaking changes
- Ensure zero-downtime implementations
- Validate all integrations through testing
- Maintain system performance levels
- Verify security compliance during integration
- Document all potential impacts
- Require approval for high-risk integrations
