# Research and APA Citation Guidelines

This document provides detailed guidelines for conducting research and applying APA 7th Edition citation style for all content within the 'Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics' textbook. Adhering to these guidelines ensures academic rigor, consistency, and traceability of information.

## 1. Research-Concurrent Workflow

As established in the [Implementation Plan](/specs/001-humanoid-robotics-book/plan.md), content development will follow a research-concurrent workflow. This means research is an ongoing activity integrated with writing, allowing for continuous updates and validation. Authors should:

*   Conduct targeted research for each section/concept during the writing phase.
*   Prioritize up-to-date information, especially for rapidly evolving fields like AI and robotics.
*   Continuously validate the accuracy of technical details and claims.

## 2. APA 7th Edition Citation Style

All external sources must be cited using APA 7th Edition guidelines. This applies to:

*   **In-text citations**: Directly after a quote or paraphrase, or when referencing a concept/idea from a source. (e.g., Author, Year; Author & Author, Year; Author et al., Year).
*   **Reference List**: A comprehensive list of all cited sources at the end of each module (or chapter), formatted according to APA 7th Edition rules.

### Key Principles for APA Citations:

*   **Accuracy**: Ensure all citation details (authors, year, title, journal, URL/DOI) are correct.
*   **Completeness**: Provide all necessary information for readers to locate the original source.
*   **Consistency**: Maintain consistent APA formatting throughout the entire textbook.

## 3. Minimum Canonical Sources per Module (or Chapter)

Each module (or a set of chapters covering a module) must reference a minimum number of authoritative sources from the last 10 years (2015-2025). This ensures content depth and relevance.

### Required Source Types and Counts:

*   **Official Documentation**: At least **2-3** references per module. Examples include official documentation for ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Unity, OpenAI Whisper, Nav2, etc.
    *   *Purpose*: For accurate technical specifications, API usage, and official best practices.
*   **Academic Papers**: At least **3-5** references per module. This includes peer-reviewed research from major AI/Robotics conferences (e.g., ICRA, IROS, NeurIPS, CVPR, AAAI) or reputable journals.
    *   *Purpose*: To cover foundational theories, state-of-the-art algorithms, recent advancements, and provide deeper theoretical context.
*   **Authoritative Books/Textbooks**: **1-2** references per module, where applicable. These are seminal works or highly regarded textbooks in robotics, AI, control theory, or related fields.
    *   *Purpose*: To provide broader conceptual context, established principles, and alternative perspectives.

## 4. Reference Template (APA 7th Edition)

Authors should use the following templates for common source types. For less common types, consult the official APA 7th Edition style guide.

### Journal Article

Author, A. A., Author, B. B., & Author, C. C. (Year). Title of article. *Title of Periodical, volume*(issue), pages. DOI (if available)

### Book

Author, A. A. (Year). *Title of work*. Publisher.

### Chapter in an Edited Book

Author, A. A. (Year). Title of chapter. In E. E. Editor & F. F. Editor (Eds.), *Title of work* (pp. pages). Publisher.

### Webpage with Author

Author, A. A. (Year, Month Day). *Title of web page*. Site Name. URL

### Webpage without Author

*Title of web page*. (Year, Month Day). Site Name. URL

### Official Documentation (e.g., ROS 2 Docs)

Organization/Author. (Year, Month Day). *Title of specific page/section*. Name of Documentation. Retrieved from URL (if specific retrieval date is necessary, otherwise omit). E.g., Open Robotics. (2023). *ROS 2 Documentation: Humble Hawksbill*. Retrieved from [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/)
