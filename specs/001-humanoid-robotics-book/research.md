# Research Approach: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## 1. Research-Concurrent Workflow

The content for this textbook will be developed using a "research-concurrent" workflow. This means that research, writing, and iterative refinement will occur in parallel rather than as distinct, sequential phases. As each section or concept is outlined, targeted research will be conducted to gather the most current and authoritative information, which will then be immediately integrated into the writing process. This approach ensures that the content remains up-to-date with rapid advancements in AI and robotics, while also allowing for continuous validation and improvement.

## 2. APA Citation Rules

All external sources referenced in the textbook will adhere strictly to APA (American Psychological Association) 7th Edition citation style. This includes in-text citations and a comprehensive reference list at the end of each module (or chapter). Proper citation ensures academic rigor, gives credit to original authors, and allows readers to explore primary sources for deeper understanding.

## 3. Minimum Canonical Sources per Module

To ensure comprehensiveness and authority, each module (which will be broken down into multiple chapters as per user clarification) will include references to a minimum number of canonical sources from the past 10 years (2015-2025). This includes:

-   **Official Documentation**: At least 2-3 references to official documentation for core technologies (e.g., ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Unity, OpenAI Whisper). These are crucial for accurate technical details and best practices.
-   **Academic Papers**: At least 3-5 references to peer-reviewed research papers from prominent AI and robotics conferences (e.g., ICRA, IROS, NeurIPS, CVPR, AAAI) or journals. These sources provide foundational theories, state-of-the-art algorithms, and recent advancements.
-   **Books/Textbooks**: 1-2 references to authoritative textbooks or seminal works in robotics, AI, or control theory, where applicable, to provide broader context and established principles.

## 4. Reference Template

References will be formatted according to APA 7th Edition guidelines. Below is a general template for common source types:

### Journal Article

Author, A. A., Author, B. B., & Author, C. C. (Year). Title of article. *Title of Periodical, volume*(issue), pages. DOI (if available)

### Book

Author, A. A. (Year). *Title of work*. Publisher.

### Chapter in an Edited Book

Author, A. A. (Year). Title of chapter. In E. E. Editor & F. F. Editor (Eds.), *Title of work* (pp. pages). Publisher.

### Webpage with Author

Author, A. A. (Year, Month Day). *Title of web page*. Site Name. URL

### Webpage without Author

*Title of web page*. (Year, Month Day). Site Name. URL

### Official Documentation (e.g., ROS 2 Docs)

Organization/Author. (Year, Month Day). *Title of specific page/section*. Name of Documentation. Retrieved from URL (if specific retrieval date is necessary, otherwise omit)
